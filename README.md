### My LaTeX Projects
Everything I have made with LaTeX is in this repository. This is mostly for my teachers if they want to see all the spew that LaTeX generates (which I will not include in my submissions).

### Structure
You can find the spew, media, and additional files (Sometimes there's a Python script or two!) in the folder titled with the project name. They aren't always the most intuitive, but they are correlated with the assignment most of the time.

This isn't a real open-source project or anything cool, just a random kid on the internet. Bye. Nothing to see here.
