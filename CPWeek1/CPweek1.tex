\section*{Problem Statement}
Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $S = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}.$ Three subsets $A,$ $B,$ $C$ of $S$ are chosen at random.

(a) Find the probability that $A \cup B \cup C = S.$

(b) Find the probability that $A \subseteq B \subseteq C.$

\section*{Solution}

\textbf{(a)}  
Each of the three subsets \( A, B, C \) is chosen independently and uniformly at random from the power set of \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\} \).  
For each element \( x \in S \), the probability that \( x \) is \emph{not} contained in any of \( A, B, \) or \( C \) is
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}.
\]
Thus, the probability that \( x \) is contained in at least one of the sets is
\[
1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}.
\]
Since the inclusion of distinct elements is independent, we have
\[
\Pr(A \cup B \cup C = S) = \left(\frac{7}{8}\right)^n.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{(b)}  
For a fixed element \( x \in S \), the condition \( A \subseteq B \subseteq C \) means that the membership indicator
\[
(\mathbf{1}_{x \in A}, \mathbf{1}_{x \in B}, \mathbf{1}_{x \in C})
\]
must be nondecreasing. The allowed membership patterns are:
\[
(0,0,0), \quad (0,0,1), \quad (0,1,1), \quad (1,1,1).
\]
There are \( 4 \) such patterns out of \( 2^3 = 8 \) total possibilities, so the probability for a single element is
\[
\frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
By independence over all \( n \) elements, we have
\[
\Pr(A \subseteq B \subseteq C) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Final Answers:}
\[
\boxed{\Pr(A \cup B \cup C = S) = \left(\frac{7}{8}\right)^n}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\boxed{\Pr(A \subseteq B \subseteq C) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n.}
\]
